This is the Penalty Chess Game, where players will play chess without knowing what their pieces are

## Notes

Our users stories had to be cut down a bit in order for us to finish by the deadline.
Many of the features requiring connection between two users was not done, and left for next milestone.
Instead, we focused on making sure the page loaded properly, with a functioning login, connection to database, chat feature, and chessboard
